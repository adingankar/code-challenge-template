Extra Credit - Deployment

-------------------------

(Optional.) Assume you are asked to get your code running in the cloud using AWS. What tools and AWS services would you use to deploy the API, database, and a scheduled version of your data ingestion code? Write up a description of your approach.

For this use if using AWS we can firstly store the data in S3 and from S3 we can then load it into Redshift if we need to maintain a data warehouse where in the data is dynamic.
If not we can then surely make use of Amazon RDS with hosted postgreSQL as this use case looks like from the perspective of supporting OLTP applications.

We can use make use Lambda function which will automatically load the data from s3 to RDS and will triggered by cloud watch which acts as the logging mechanism.
The replication of REST API is API gateway/Elastic Beanstalk which can be easily used with containerization with docker using ECS.
